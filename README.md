CS 260 application

This was a really helpful exercise for me. I've used git before for my job but I always did it using the command line and never experimented with modifying things on github or with the visual studio git extension. One problem I always ran into was resolving merge conflicts. With the visual studio extension it was much easier to see the conflict and resolve it.

Elevator Pitch: Social Media is a huge industry in today's world, but it's also a huge problem. There's so much negativity that comes from Social Media apps. That's why I created "ShoutOut". It's a social media app focused on spreading positivity. Users can write "ShoutOuts", short messages like tweets that begin with the word "shoutout", recognizing what they appreciate about people, places, things, and even other users. "ShoutOut" is simple, fun, and will encourage people to look for the good in the world aroung them.

Key features:
    - secure login over HTTPS
    - ability to write "shoutouts" and post them for other users to see
    - ability to see posts from other users
    - ability to follow other users
    - can view your own profile and see posts you have made and how many followers, following you have
